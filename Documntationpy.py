#for constracte a list It have 2 methode:
#1st methode: Simple methode;
#2nd methode: we use list() function
lis = list(("raouf",True,15,2.01,'Hayt '))

#Negative Indexing
#Negative indexing means start from the end: -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.

#2nd method
#To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.
#The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print(thislist)

#To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

#Looping Using List Comprehension
#List Comprehension offers the shortest syntax for looping through lists:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]
#to write a short syntex for creating the new list from an old list:
#The syntax:
#newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
print(newlist)
#for sorting the list:
#alphabetically:

thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)
#descending:
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort(reverse = True)
print(thislist)
#descending:
thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort(reverse = True)
print(thislist)

#Case Insensitive Sort
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]

#list method:
# Method	        Description
# append()       Adds an element at the end of the list
# clear()        Removes all the elements from the list
# copy()	       Returns a copy of the list
# count()        Returns the number of elements with the specified value
# extend()       Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
# index()        Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
# insert()       Adds an element at the specified position
# pop()	         Removes the element at the specified position
# remove()       Removes the item with the specified value
# reverse()      Reverses the order of the list
# sort()	       Sorts the list

#Create a Tuple:

y.remove("apple")
thistuple = tuple(y)

#The del keyword can delete the tuple completely:

del thistuple

#in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking":
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
(green, yellow, red) = fruits
print(green)

# Tuple Methods
# count()	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
# index()	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found

#A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
#Sets are written with curly brackets.
#Create a Set:

#Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
#Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
#Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
#Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
#Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.
#Duplicates Not Allowed
#Sets cannot have two items with the same value.
#To determine how many items a set has, use the len() function.
#Set items can be of any data type.
#A set can contain different data types.

#From Python's perspective, sets are defined as objects with the data type 'set':
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

#To add items from another set into the current set, use the update() method.
#Add elements from tropical into thisset:

#The del keyword will delete the set completely:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
del thisset

#You can loop through the set items by using a for loop:

#There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.
#You can use the union() method that returns a new set containing all items from both sets, or the update() method that inserts all the items from one set into another:
#The union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets:

#Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)

#Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

#A dictionary can contain dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}
#Or, if you want to add three dictionaries into a new dictionary:
child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
  "name" : "Linus",
  "year" : 2011
}
myfamily = {
  "child1" : child1,
  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3
}
print(myfamily["child2"]["name"])

#if else is same as c But we there is an additions:
#elif is same as else if in c;

#One line if else statement:
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")

#One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:
a = 330
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

#if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  pass

#while loop in python is same as in c but with the addition:
#With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next;
#With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")

#for loop is same as in c but with The addition:
#Break the loop when x is 3, and see what happens with the else block;
#The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3);
#The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6);
#With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next;
#for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

#Creating a Function
#In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
#To call it:
my_function()
#Arguments
# Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
# Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.
# The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:
def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " Refsnes")
my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")

#Number of Arguments
# By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.
# This function expects 2 arguments, and gets 2 arguments:
def my_function(fname, lname):
  print(fname + " " + lname)
my_function("Emil", "Refsnes")

#Arbitrary Arguments, *args
# If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a * before the parameter name in the function definition.
# This way the function will receive a tuple of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:
# If the number of arguments is unknown, add a * before the parameter name:
def my_function(*kids):
  print("The youngest child is " + kids[2])
my_function("Emil", "Tobias", "Linus")

#Keyword Arguments
# You can also send arguments with the key = value syntax.
# This way the order of the arguments does not matter.
def my_function(child3, child2, child1):
  print("The youngest child is " + child3)
my_function(child1 = "Emil", child2 = "Tobias", child3 = "Linus")

#The phrase Keyword Arguments are often shortened to kwargs in Python documentations.
# Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs
# If you do not know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function, add two asterisk: ** before the parameter name in the function definition.
# This way the function will receive a dictionary of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:
# If the number of keyword arguments is unknown, add a double ** before the parameter name:
def my_function(**kid):
  print("His last name is " + kid["lname"])
my_function(fname = "Tobias", lname = "Refsnes")

#Arbitrary Kword Arguments are often shortened to **kwargs in Python documentations.

# Default Parameter Value
# The following example shows how to use a default parameter value.
# If we call the function without argument, it uses the default value:
def my_function(country = "Norway"):
  print("I am from " + country)
my_function("Sweden")
my_function("India")
my_function()
my_function("Brazil")

#You can send any data types of argument to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), and it will be treated as the same data type inside the function.
#To let a function return a value, use the return statement:
def my_function(x):
  return 5 * x
print(my_function(3))
print(my_function(5))
print(my_function(9))

#function definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a function definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
def myfunction():
  pass

#The Recursion in python is same as in c;

#A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression
#Syntax
# lambda arguments : expression
#Add 10 to argument a, and return the result:
x = lambda a : a + 10
print(x(5))
#Multiply argument a with argument b and return the result:
x = lambda a, b : a * b
print(x(5, 6))

#Why Use Lambda Functions?
# The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.
# Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:
def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n
mydoubler = myfunc(2)
print(mydoubler(11))
#Use lambda functions when an anonymous function is required for a short period of time.

#You can use the append() method to add an element to an array.
cars = ["laib"]
# Add one more element to the cars array:
cars.append("Honda")

# Method	      Description
# append()	    Adds an element at the end of the list
# clear()	      Removes all the elements from the list
# copy()	      Returns a copy of the list
# count()	      Returns the number of elements with the specified value
# extend()	    Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
# index()	      Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
# insert()	    Adds an element at the specified position
# pop()	        Removes the element at the specified position
# remove()	    Removes the first item with the specified value
# reverse()	    Reverses the order of the list
# sort()	      Sorts the list

#Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
class MyClass:
  x = 5
#Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)

#The __init__() Function
# The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.
# To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
# All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
# Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
#Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
#The __str__() Function
# The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
# If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:
# The string representation of an object WITH the __str__() function:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"
p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1)

# Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.
# Let us create a method in the Person class:
# Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)
p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()

#The self Parameter
# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
# It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:
#Use the words mysillyobject and abc instead of self:
class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
    mysillyobject.name = name
    mysillyobject.age = age
  def myfunc(abc):
    print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)
p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()

# Modify Object Properties
# You can modify properties on objects like this:
# Set the age of p1 to 40:
p1.age = 40

#Delete Object Properties
# You can delete properties on objects by using the del keyword:
# Delete the age property from the p1 object:
del p1.age

#Delete Objects
# You can delete objects by using the del keyword:
# Delete the p1 object:
del p1

#The pass Statement
# class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
class Person:
  pass

# Python Inheritance
# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
# Create a Parent Class
# Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class:
# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:
x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()
# Create a Child Class
# To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class:
# Create a class named Student, which will inherit the properties and methods from the Person class:
class Student(Person):
  pass

# Note: Use the pass keyword when you do not want to add any other properties or methods to the class.
# Now the Student class has the same properties and methods as the Person class.
# Use the Student class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:
x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()

# Add the __init__() Function
# So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from its parent.
# We want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of the pass keyword).# 
# Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
# Add the __init__() function to the Student class:
# class student(Person):
#   def __init__(self, fname, lname):
#     #add properties etc.

# When you add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer inherit the parent's __init__() function.
# Note: The child's __init__() function overrides the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function.
# To keep the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function, add a call to the parent's __init__() function:
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)
  
# Now we have successfully added the __init__() function, and kept the inheritance of the parent class, and we are ready to add functionality in the __init__() function.
# Use the super() Function
# Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)

# By using the super() function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element, it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent. 
# Add Properties
# Add a property called graduationyear to the Student class:

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = 2019

# In the example below, the year 2019 should be a variable, and passed into the Student class when creating student objects. To do so, add another parameter in the __init__() function:
# Add a year parameter, and pass the correct year when creating objects:
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year
x = Student("Mike", "Olsen", 2019)

# Add Methods
# Add a method called welcome to the Student class:
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year
  def welcome(self):
    print("Welcome", self.firstname, self.lastname, "to the class of", self.graduationyear)
    
# If you add a method in the child class with the same name as a function in the parent class, the inheritance of the parent method will be overridden.

#Python Iterators
# Python Iterators
# An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.
# An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.
# Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().
# Iterator vs Iterable
# Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.
# All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator: 
#Get your own Python Server
# Return an iterator from a tuple, and print each value:
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
myit = iter(mytuple)
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))

# Even strings are iterable objects, and can return an iterator:
# Strings are also iterable objects, containing a sequence of characters:
mystr = "banana"
myit = iter(mystr)
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))

# Looping Through an Iterator
# We can also use a for loop to iterate through an iterable object:
# Iterate the values of a tuple:
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for x in mytuple:
  print(x)
# Iterate the characters of a string:
mystr = "banana"
for x in mystr:
  print(x)

# The for loop actually creates an iterator object and executes the next() method for each loop.
# Create an Iterator
# To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object.
# As you have learned in the Python Classes/Objects chapter, all classes have a function called __init__(), which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created.
# The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.
# The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.
# Create an iterator that returns numbers, starting with 1, and each sequence will increase by one (returning 1,2,3,4,5 etc.):
class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self
  def __next__(self):
    x = self.a
    self.a += 1
    return x
myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
StopIteration

# The example above would continue forever if you had enough next() statements, or if it was used in a for loop.
# To prevent the iteration from going on forever, we can use the StopIteration statement.
# In the __next__() method, we can add a terminating condition to raise an error if the iteration is done a specified number of times:
# Stop after 20 iterations:
class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self
  def __next__(self):
    if self.a <= 20:
      x = self.a
      self.a += 1
      return x
    else:
      raise StopIteration
myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)
for x in myiter:
  print(x)
