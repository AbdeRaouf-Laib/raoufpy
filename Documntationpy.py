#for constracte a list It have 2 methode:
#1st methode: Simple methode;
#2nd methode: we use list() function
lis = list(("raouf",True,15,2.01,'Hayt '))

#Negative Indexing
#Negative indexing means start from the end: -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.

#2nd method
#To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.
#The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print(thislist)

#To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

#Looping Using List Comprehension
#List Comprehension offers the shortest syntax for looping through lists:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]
#to write a short syntex for creating the new list from an old list:
#The syntax:
#newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
print(newlist)
#for sorting the list:
#alphabetically:

thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort()
print(thislist)
#descending:
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort(reverse = True)
print(thislist)
#descending:
thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]
thislist.sort(reverse = True)
print(thislist)

#Case Insensitive Sort
thislist = ["banana", "Orange", "Kiwi", "cherry"]

#list method:
# Method	        Description
# append()       Adds an element at the end of the list
# clear()        Removes all the elements from the list
# copy()	       Returns a copy of the list
# count()        Returns the number of elements with the specified value
# extend()       Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
# index()        Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
# insert()       Adds an element at the specified position
# pop()	         Removes the element at the specified position
# remove()       Removes the item with the specified value
# reverse()      Reverses the order of the list
# sort()	       Sorts the list

#Create a Tuple:

y.remove("apple")
thistuple = tuple(y)

#The del keyword can delete the tuple completely:

del thistuple

#in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking":
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
(green, yellow, red) = fruits
print(green)

# Tuple Methods
# count()	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
# index()	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found

#A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
#Sets are written with curly brackets.
#Create a Set:

#Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
#Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
#Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
#Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
#Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.
#Duplicates Not Allowed
#Sets cannot have two items with the same value.
#To determine how many items a set has, use the len() function.
#Set items can be of any data type.
#A set can contain different data types.

#From Python's perspective, sets are defined as objects with the data type 'set':
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

#To add items from another set into the current set, use the update() method.
#Add elements from tropical into thisset:

#The del keyword will delete the set completely:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
del thisset

#You can loop through the set items by using a for loop:

#There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.
#You can use the union() method that returns a new set containing all items from both sets, or the update() method that inserts all the items from one set into another:
#The union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets:

#Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)

#Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

#A dictionary can contain dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}
#Or, if you want to add three dictionaries into a new dictionary:
child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
  "name" : "Linus",
  "year" : 2011
}
myfamily = {
  "child1" : child1,
  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3
}
print(myfamily["child2"]["name"])

#COMMENTS:
#-The number of spaces is up to use as a programmer but it has to be at least one; 
#And we have to use the same of spaces number in the block of code! 
if 5 < 2:

#-python is accepte the power of 10 and he he was write:
power = 12e4
 #or 
powera = 12E4
#-You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods and You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.:
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)

#this same values are return False: False , None , 0 , "" ,() , [] ,{}

#The precedence order is described in the table below, starting with the highest precedence at the top:

#-Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.
#-Note: The length of the list will change when the number of items inserted does not match the number of items replaced.
#By default the sort() method is case sensitive, resulting in all capital letters being sorted before lower case letters.
#Note: You cannot remove items in a tuple.
#Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
#Note: The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:
#Note: If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.
#Note: If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error.
#Note: Sets are unordered, so when using the pop() method, you do not know which item that gets removed.
#Note: Both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items.
#Note: The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates;
